# About
For this one, I though it was better to do a readME as well. This tutorial is a plain "this does this", so there's no solution per se. So I will probably just make a small project with testing some of the concepts taught in the video.

## Notes
I might also upload "lecture notes" I take from this course. It seems to me that it is the best way to get this theoretical stuff out of the way.
