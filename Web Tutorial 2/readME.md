# About
For this one, I though it was better to do a readME as well. This tutorial is a plain "this does this", so there's no solution per se. So I will probably just make a small project with testing some of the concepts taught in the video.

## Notes
I might also upload "lecture notes" I take from this course. It seems to me that it is the best way to get this theoretical stuff out of the way.

JS is fun and useful, but to better progress I have made the choice to first prefect my HTML and my CSS before diving into JS. I won't be learning them as in dept as I am learning JS, but I still think I need a better understanding of these 2 languages before continuing this learning. For now, so long JS. See you in a year or so ðŸ«‚
